# Health Insighter Project

## Background
The Health Insighter project aims to provide comprehensive insights into health data using advanced data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize health-related data to understand health insurance coverage, overall self-rated health status, and their correlations with factors such as wealth, employment status, and living arrangements. This project leverages the power of data integration and analytics to transform healthcare services and inform policy-making.

## Approach to Implementation

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources:** Public health datasets covering demographics, insurance coverage, and health outcomes.
- **Data Ingestion:** Data is loaded from CSV files using custom-built functions in the `DataProcessor` class.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data to ensure consistency and reliability.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Further processing of data to make it analysis-ready, including mapping ordinal categories to numeric values.

### Data Analysis and Modeling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and generate initial insights using statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed multiple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to assess health risks based on the available data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics to ensure robustness and reliability.

### Dashboard Development
- **Tools Used:** Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization; Dash and Plotly for creating interactive dashboards.
- **Dashboard Layout:** Defined in the `dashboard.py` class, which sets up the layout and visualization components.
- **Visualization:** Various charts and graphs to present data insights interactively.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Heroku for easy accessibility and scalability.

### Error-Handling Mechanisms
- Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure the applicationâ€™s reliability.
